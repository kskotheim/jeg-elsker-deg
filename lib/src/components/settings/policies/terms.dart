Charges for Service

Snapdragon Apps  reserves the right to introduce in-app-purchase(s) to unlock additional functionality beyond the free experience. This may include the ability to keep many more notes and additional features which are currently in development. 

Third Party Services T&C
The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.
	•	Google Play Services: https://play.google.com/intl/en-us_us/about/play-terms/
	•	Google Analytics for Firebase: https://firebase.google.com/terms

Internet Connection Required
My Love stores the notes that are displayed each day on Firebase servers operated by Google, so the app requires an active internet connection to work. Snapdragon Apps does not take responsibility for any data charges associated with this connection or any loss of functionality due to an unavailable or interrupted connection. 

Updates, Compatibility, Termination of Service
The app is currently available on Android & iOS – the requirements for both systems may change, and system updates may be required to continue to use the app. Snapdragon Apps does not promise that it will always be able to update the app so that it works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device. Snapdragon Apps reserves the right to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you, but we will always make effort to avoid this outcome and give appropriate notice before significant changes or termination of the service. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

Changes to This Terms and Conditions
We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.
These terms and conditions are effective as of 2020-08-15
